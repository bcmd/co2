# The influence of carbon dioxide on cerebral metabolism and oxygen consumption: combining multimodal monitoring with dynamic systems modelling

This repository contains model definitions and input data used in Cooper et al (2021), *The influence of carbon dioxide on cerebral metabolism and oxygen consumption: combining multimodal monitoring with dynamic systems modelling*.

## Model
The model file `BS_DH.modeldef` contains the model definition in [BCMD][bcmd] format.

## Data
The experimental data and optimal parameters for the substrate supply optimisation can be found in the [BCMD][bcmd] input file `substrate_optimal.input`

## Executing
The model file together with the input file can be executed within the [BCMD][bcmd] modelling environment. Detailed instructions for using the software are available in the linked repository.
